# Strlix Project Context

Read this first in every new AI/Codex/Cursor task.

## North Star

Strlix is building a personal commitment OS for phones.

The product is not a normal app blocker. The long-term goal is: a user speaks or types a messy commitment in natural language, the system understands it, converts it into structured policy, and the phone behavior changes around that promise.

Examples:

- "Only Neso Academy OS playlist for 3 hours. No Shorts. Lock me if I drift."
- "No porn for 1 year, but keep the rest of my phone normal."
- "Allow Instagram messages, but block Reels during work."
- "Let me watch 40 Shorts, but block adult content and stop me after the quota."
- "Tomorrow I have an exam. Allow only study YouTube and required browser search."

The unique idea is promise-relative control inside apps, not just blocking whole apps.

## Core Law

```text
user promise -> Promise Compiler -> structured policy -> PolicyEngine -> overlay/action -> log
```

AI suggests. Policy decides. Overlay enforces. Logs prove what happened.

Never let a model directly become the final authority for dangerous user-facing actions. The PolicyEngine is the law.

## Two Product Layers

### Commitment Worlds

Temporary worlds for a goal:

- Study World
- Deep Work World
- Monk Mode
- Sleep World
- Recovery World

These are session-based and may last minutes, hours, or days.

### Life Rules

Long-term commitments independent of a session:

- no porn for 1 year
- no betting apps
- no toxic chat apps
- no uninstall/tamper during strict commitments

These should be harder to remove than normal session rules, while still preserving emergency and safety paths.

## Current Priority

The current product must become reliable before expanding.

The first reliable loop is:

```text
start promise -> detect phone context -> decide with policy -> warn/block/lock -> show reason -> log event
```

Do not chase UI polish, mascot, payments, full phone operator, or extra Azure experiments if this loop is broken.

## Working System

Use separate chats/tasks for separate kinds of work so context stays clean and API cost stays controlled.

### Main / Android / Backend Chat

Use this for implementation, tests, phone verification, backend wiring, overlay behavior, and release-gate checks.

This chat owns:

- Android app code
- backend endpoints
- phone/ADB verification
- bug reproduction
- build/test/install loops
- safety-critical enforcement behavior

### AI Lab Chat

Use this for promise understanding, prompts, datasets, evals, model comparisons, and Azure inference experiments.

This chat owns:

- Promise Compiler prompt versions
- messy promise datasets
- red-team cases
- eval metrics
- model routing recommendations
- clarification quality

### Research Lab Chat

Use this for deep unknowns before coding.

This chat owns:

- Android control-plane research
- Device Owner / MDM / Shizuku / OS-level options
- competitor teardown
- product strategy
- scientific hypotheses
- billion-user trust and safety analysis

When a hard problem appears, do not immediately patch one symptom. First ask the Research Lab for the strongest legal, ethical, owner-consented solution, the constraints, the proof experiments, and the recommendation for now vs later.

### Control-Room Rule

This current/main Codex conversation is the control room. It decides which track gets the next task, verifies outputs, keeps the north star intact, and prevents random one-off fixes.

## Long-Term Direction

After the core blocker is reliable, Strlix should grow toward:

- natural-language promise compiler
- confirm-before-start flow
- promise-specific YouTube/channel/video rules
- inside-app behavior control such as Shorts vs lectures, Reels vs messages
- permanent guardrails
- recovery and accountability paths
- optional vision understanding when screen text is insufficient
- safe phone operator assistant for user-approved tasks

## Safety Principles

- Always allow emergency paths.
- Never silently capture private screens.
- Never collect OTP, banking, passwords, or private messages for cloud classification.
- Strong mode must be pre-consented before it starts.
- Any paid escape or accountability penalty must be chosen before the commitment, not forced during distress.
- AI can warn, explain, and suggest; final enforcement must go through policy.
